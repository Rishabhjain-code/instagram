This is a Social Media App, with a particular purpose like Fitness, Motivation or Studying purpose. Social media is distracting due to the huge and variety of content it has and scrolling nature, we can neither leave it altogether nor use it because it become an addiction easily. But we need to use social media for a variety/purpose like motivation [when we want all content of motivation nature] or fitness or study materials etc. So that even if we use Social Media we are not distracted and get what we want. This is the prototype for the same. 


Most important thing I learned is that, you do not know everything, neither any organization expects you to know, important thing is to find the way out using the Google Search Effectively. During this project I have used so much Google Search, that even if I had to tell what all I learnt - I cannot do it unless I look all the history of search. But still something I can recall is that I have learned many new concepts - including Frontend [ReactJS, HTML, CSS and JS], designing creative and simple UI, using of various libraries and frameworks, backend [API concept and Use, Backend Server, Integration of Backend and Frontend via the ReactJS etc]. Most fun part was the use of Javascript for both frontend and backend, and how beautifully it integrates both the ends. Various concepts like - Hoisting, Contexting etc in Javascript. These are just example of the learnings, actual learning is very immense as it gave a small idea of the Software and functioning of Website. 

As I build this to develop the skills of Web Development, there are some things which are missed in this, but still it taught a lot of concepts to me.
Scope of Improvement Includes - 

##### Scale the Website
##### Add more users to the website
