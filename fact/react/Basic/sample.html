<!-- most important thing in react is the identify component nature of the react.
    Biggest component is the app attached on the root div, it has 2 more components - inputBox , Tasks[0,1,2.....]

    components of 2 types = 1.stateless functional components(SFC) - dont have their state - SFC easy to write 
                            2.Class Based Componenets(have state)
